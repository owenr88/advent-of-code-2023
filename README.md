# Advent of Code 2023

![Welcome!](https://media.giphy.com/media/OF0yOAufcWLfi/giphy.gif)

How are you doing? Good. Yeah, same.

These are my [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2023/) submissions for 2023. Let's see if I get beyond day 10 this year ðŸ‘€

I'm trying to do it all in pure TypeScript, with the help of only [Lodash](https://lodash.com/).

## Running the code

`yarn test` to run all tests to make sure they're passing

## Starting a new day

`yarn plop` to create the template for the day
